## **Clustering Indian States based on most visited Venues**
# **Introduction/Business Problem**

There are around 29 states in India, can we find out which are the most visited states in India? and why do people visit those states? 
Is it because they want to do business? or Just want to travel? 
Some other questions are
-Finding most visited business place?
-Finding most visited bus stations in the state.?
-In which city people visit bar most of the time?
Well there are many questions we can ask based on the location and data we have.
Problem we are solving here is anyone who wants to know about what perticular place is known for.
Eg. Kerala	is known for "Indian Restaurant Food" so if we plan to visit Kerala, We will atleast visit some Indian Restaurant and experince some good food.
Problem is to cluster the states based on their most visited venues and based on that providing good recommendation to people who are trying to know about what perticular state/city is know for.
